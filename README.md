The Apple Watch datasets can be found at https://physionet.org/content/sleep-accel/1.0.0/

The liverpool actigraphy and the code from https://github.com/salah-adi/LSTM-HAR were provided by the supervisor and some parts of these algorithms were used for this project. To distinguish the author's code from the imported code, there will be a "imported code1" comment next to the former's code and "imported code2" comment next to the latter's code.
